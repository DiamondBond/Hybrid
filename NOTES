#replace all single letter variables with either count if used in loops or a proper variable name. (~Diamond)

#what do you mean by 'all tabs are 8 characters'?? (~hoholee12)
#
#CodingStyle:
#No single letter variables, unless its completely useless and does not have a meaning...(at least for loops)
#Use tabs
#All tabs are 8 characters
#80 character line limit
#make one base for loop(such as title or body)
#functions should end itself if done working and go back to the base automagically.
#don't call base function just to go back to it, else we'd have a function inside function inside function ......
#typical thread bomb or memleak method..
#solution is to remove all base function callings on other functions.(although i dont want to touch this because i dont know what will break.. havent seen through yet:p)
