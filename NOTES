#CodingStyle:
No single letter variables, unless its completely useless and does not have a meaning...(at least for loops)
Use tabs
All tabs are 8 characters
80 character line limit
Single base loops
Functions should end themselfs and go back to the parent function / loop
Dont call functions within functions as it causes a memory leak to build
solution is to remove all base function callings on other functions.(although i dont want to touch this because i dont know what will break.. havent seen through yet:p)

#Msgs:
(From:Diamond - To:Deic) I deleted all the stuff in the file server that is in tags and etc... please use the main directory, its messy and makes long links to use tags and releases lol :) if you wanna make a zip then zip and upload to the fileserver repo, thanks m8! :D
(From:Lee - To:Diamond) what do you mean by 'all tabs are 8 characters'??
(From:Diamond - To:Lee) can we call you lee? lol or hoho? or santa? or your real name? xD
also:
some email clients or editors and etc revert to prehistoric methods of tabbing, they use 4 spaces, anyways dont worry
about it, just use a modern text editor (sublime text, atom, vim if your into that... lol) and you should be fine since
they automatically parse tabs as 4 chars and so forth...
